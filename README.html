<p>&#8220;What Did We Eat??&#8221; is a crowd-sourcing calorie-counter designed to give light-hearted insight into the eating habits of anonymous people.</p>

<p>The purpose of the project was to learn a more advanced MV* framework (this time Backbone.js), use a new API (Nutritionix) and also to make a more production-ready &#8220;looking&#8221; app.</p>

<p>The app is hosted on gh-pages for live demo purposes and can be found <a href="http://llanginger.github.io/health-tracker/">here:</a></p>
